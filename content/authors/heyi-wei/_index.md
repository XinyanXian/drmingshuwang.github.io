## About Me

Dr. Heyi Wei is a recent PhD graduate from the School of Geographical and Earth Sciences at the University of Glasgow, where she conducted her doctoral research under the supervision of Dr. Mingshu Wang. Her research focused on environmental geography and the application of remote sensing technologies to monitor urban environmental changes and assess climate change impacts.

During her PhD studies, Heyi developed innovative methodologies for using satellite imagery and geospatial analysis to understand environmental dynamics in urban areas. Her work particularly focused on how urbanization affects local climate patterns and environmental quality, contributing to our understanding of urban sustainability challenges.

Heyi's research has been published in several high-impact journals and she has presented her findings at international conferences on environmental geography and remote sensing. Her work bridges the gap between environmental science and urban studies, providing valuable insights for sustainable urban development.
