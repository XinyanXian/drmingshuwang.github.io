We are thrilled to announce that our research group has been awarded a **Â£500,000 research grant** from the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) to support our groundbreaking work on **"Explainable AI for Urban Systems: Advancing People-Centric Urban Analytics"**.

## Project Overview

This three-year project will focus on developing explainable artificial intelligence methods for understanding urban systems from a people-centric perspective. The research will address critical challenges in:

### Research Objectives

- **Developing interpretable AI models** for urban data analysis
- **Creating people-centric urban analytics** frameworks
- **Advancing explainable AI** in geospatial contexts
- **Building practical tools** for urban planners and policymakers

### Expected Outcomes

The project is expected to deliver:

1. **Novel AI methodologies** for urban analysis
2. **Open-source software tools** for the research community
3. **Policy recommendations** for urban development
4. **Training opportunities** for early-career researchers

## Research Team

The project will support:

- **2 PhD students** working on different aspects of urban AI
- **1 Postdoctoral researcher** focusing on explainable AI methods
- **Collaborative partnerships** with international institutions

## Impact and Applications

This research will have significant implications for:

- **Urban planning** and smart city development
- **Policy making** for sustainable urban growth
- **Environmental monitoring** and management
- **Transportation** and mobility planning

## Collaboration Opportunities

We welcome collaborations with researchers, practitioners, and organizations interested in urban AI and explainable machine learning. Please get in touch if you would like to explore potential partnerships.
