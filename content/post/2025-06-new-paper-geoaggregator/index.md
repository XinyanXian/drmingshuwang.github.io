We are excited to announce the publication of our latest research paper titled **"GeoAggregator: An Efficient Transformer Model for Geo-Spatial Tabular Data"** in a leading journal.

## Key Contributions

This work introduces GeoAggregator, a novel transformer-based model specifically designed for processing geo-spatial tabular data. The key innovations include:

- **Spatial-aware attention mechanism** that captures geographical relationships
- **Efficient aggregation strategies** for handling large-scale spatial datasets
- **Superior performance** compared to existing methods on multiple benchmarks

## Research Impact

The GeoAggregator model addresses a critical gap in the field of geospatial machine learning by providing an efficient and effective solution for processing tabular data with spatial components. This work has significant implications for:

- Urban planning and development
- Environmental monitoring
- Transportation analysis
- Location-based services

## Collaboration

This research was conducted in collaboration with researchers from multiple institutions and represents a significant advancement in the application of transformer models to geospatial data.

## Access

The paper is now available online and the code will be made available on our GitHub repository soon.
