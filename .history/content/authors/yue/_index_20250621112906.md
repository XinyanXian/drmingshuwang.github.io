## About Me

I am a PhD student in the School of Geographical and Earth Sciences at the University of Glasgow, working under the supervision of Dr. Mingshu Wang. My research focuses on urban informatics and the application of geospatial data science to understand smart city development and urban sustainability.

## Research Interests

My research interests include:
- **Urban Informatics**: Analyzing urban systems using big data and computational methods
- **Smart Cities**: Understanding how technology can improve urban living
- **Geospatial Data Science**: Developing innovative methods for spatial data analysis
- **Urban Planning**: Supporting evidence-based urban planning and policy making
- **Sustainability**: Exploring pathways to sustainable urban development

## Current Research

I am currently working on projects related to smart city analytics and urban sustainability indicators. My work involves developing new methodologies for analyzing urban data to support sustainable city planning and management.

## Background

With a strong foundation in geography and urban planning, I bring interdisciplinary perspectives to urban research. My previous studies have equipped me with skills in GIS, spatial analysis, and urban theory, which I now apply to cutting-edge research in urban informatics.
